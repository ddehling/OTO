1) The current program to run the system is Stories.py
2) On Linux, there was an issue with the networking stack that required expanding the allocated network buffer (or something).
    The problem appeared as some of the reciever boxes updating at a very slow frame rate. 
    The ethernet data was clearly not being sent at full speed.
    Add the following lines to /etc/sysctl.conf:
        net.core.wmem_max=16777216
        net.core.wmem_default=16777216
3) In Stories.py, the rendering window can be disabled by setting self.scheduler.state["simulate"] to False
4) If getting port audio errors on linux use sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev
