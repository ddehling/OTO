# LED-Sign Project Brief

## Project Overview

The LED-Sign project is a sophisticated system for controlling LED displays with dynamic visual effects, environmental simulations, and audio integration. It creates an immersive visual experience through a combination of procedurally generated content, environmental simulations, and coordinated audio-visual effects.

## Core Requirements

1. **LED Display Control**
   - Control multiple LED display units via sACN protocol
   - Support for different display configurations and layouts
   - Ability to address individual LEDs with precise color control

2. **Visual Effects System**
   - Real-time rendering of dynamic visual content
   - Environmental simulation (weather, time of day, etc.)
   - Celestial body simulation (moon, planets, stars)
   - Special effects (lightning, aurora, fog, etc.)
   - Themed scenes (forest, mountain, mushrooms, etc.)

3. **Audio Integration**
   - Ambient sound playback synchronized with visual scenes
   - Audio-reactive visual effects
   - Event-triggered sound effects
   - Microphone input analysis for interactive effects

4. **Event System**
   - Scheduling and coordination of visual and audio events
   - Transition system between different environmental states
   - Random event generation based on configurable parameters
   - OSC (Open Sound Control) message handling for external control

## Technical Goals

1. **Performance**
   - Maintain stable frame rate for smooth animations
   - Efficient rendering pipeline to minimize latency
   - Optimized network communication with LED controllers

2. **Flexibility**
   - Modular architecture for easy addition of new effects
   - Configurable parameters for fine-tuning visual appearance
   - Support for different display configurations

3. **Reliability**
   - Robust error handling for network communication
   - Graceful degradation in case of hardware issues
   - Stable long-term operation

## User Experience Goals

1. **Immersion**
   - Create a believable and engaging environmental simulation
   - Smooth transitions between different states
   - Cohesive audio-visual experience

2. **Variety**
   - Wide range of visual effects and scenes
   - Dynamic and evolving content that doesn't feel repetitive
   - Surprising and delightful random events

3. **Responsiveness**
   - Real-time reaction to audio input
   - Immediate response to control inputs
   - Adaptive behavior based on environmental parameters

## Project Scope

The LED-Sign project focuses on creating a complete system for controlling LED displays with rich visual content. It includes:

1. The core rendering and control software
2. A library of visual effects and scenes
3. Audio integration and sound management
4. Configuration tools for different display setups

The project does not include:
1. Hardware design for LED displays
2. Low-level LED driver implementation
3. Content creation tools (though it supports programmatic content generation)
