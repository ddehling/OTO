## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions

1. **Rendering Approach**
   - **Decision**: Continue using OpenGL for rendering rather than switching to a different graphics API
   - **Rationale**: OpenGL provides good performance, cross-platform support, and the existing codebase is built around it
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Vulkan, DirectX, pure CPU rendering
   - **Status**: Confirmed, continuing with OpenGL

2. **Audio Processing**
   - **Decision**: Enhance the threaded audio engine for better performance
   - **Rationale**: Current implementation works but could benefit from optimization
   - **Alternatives Considered**: External audio processing library, separate audio process
   - **Status**: In progress, evaluating options

3. **Network Protocol**
   - **Decision**: Continue using sACN for LED control
   - **Rationale**: Industry standard with good support and compatibility
   - **Alternatives Considered**: Art-Net, custom UDP protocol
   - **Status**: Confirmed, but exploring additional protocols for specific use cases

### Design Considerations

1. **Visual Aesthetic**
   - **Direction**: Natural and organic with occasional surreal elements
   - **Key Principles**: Fluid motion, natural color palettes, subtle transitions
   - **Open Questions**: Balance between realism and artistic expression

2. **Interaction Model**
   - **Direction**: Primarily autonomous with subtle responsiveness to environment
   - **Key Principles**: Non-intrusive, discoverable, surprising
   - **Open Questions**: Level of direct control vs. emergent behavior

3. **Content Strategy**
   - **Direction**: Procedurally generated with occasional scripted sequences
   - **Key Principles**: Variety, non-repetition, contextual appropriateness
   - **Open Questions**: Balance between randomness and designed experiences
